      Downloads and installs nvm and uses it to install a specific node version.

      node_global_modules_to_install:
        description: >-
          A dict of with required `name` and optional `version` keys. The `name` is the name of the npm module to
          install. The `version` is the specific version.
          
          If `version` is omitted, the latest version is installed.

        default: {}
      node_npm_version:
        description: >-
          The version of npm to install.

          The special string `latest` will install the latest version.
          
          If omitted (i.e., None), no version is installed (i.e., the version that comes with node will be used). This
          is the default behavior.
        type: str
        # Default is None, but this makes validation explode.
      node_version:
        description: >-
          The node version to install. Must be supported by nvm.
          
          Do not include the leading `v`. E.g., to install node version v20.0.0, pass "20.0.0".
