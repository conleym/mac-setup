# Bootstrap further playbooks, installing essentials.
#   This playbook is run by bootstrap.sh during initial setup. It is also included in setup-playbook so that everything's
#   kept up to date.
# Does the following:
#  1. Ensures Xcode's first launch setup is complete.
#  2. Installs MacPorts
#  3. Installs the ports required by setup-playbook. See bootstrap_ports_to_install in `vars/ports.yml` for the list.
