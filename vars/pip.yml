# Packages to install with pip (for python 3 only)
#
# Defines two lists, one for global packages (installed for all users in the python system library directory), and
# another for the current user. The latter is strongly recommended.
#
# Full requirements.txt syntax is supported for each package in the list.
# See https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#pip-install-examples for examples, and
# https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#requirements-file-format for details.
